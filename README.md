This application can be viewed and built using the latest version of Xcode, and tested via the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device. 

To view the current temperature and weather status at a given location, search by a City Name or Zip Code using the Search Bar: ex. "Denver", or "90210".

You may also allow usage of the device location while using the app to view the weather at your current location.
