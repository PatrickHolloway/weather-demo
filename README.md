# weather-demo

This application can be viewed and built using the latest version of Xcode (12.5), and tested via the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device. 

To view the current temperature and weather status at a given location, search by a City Name or Zip Code using the Search Bar: ex. "Denver", "Denver, Colorado", or "90210". \*NOTE: The OpenWeather API does not currently support seraching with a state abbreviation (ex. "Denver, CO"). This could be handled in a future update by converting the abbreviation to a full state name before making the query.

You may also allow usage of the device location while using the app to view the weather at your current location.
